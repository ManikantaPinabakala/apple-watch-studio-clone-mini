# Apple Watch Studio Clone

I worked on this project as an assignment for an interview. This app is a mini clone to the `Apple Watch Studio` website where you can design / customize the apple watch as you need before buying it.

To run this project on your computer, follow the below steps:

- Clone this repository to your machine (using command prompt or terminal)
- Make sure your machine has the following dependencies:

  - react (v18 or above)
  - react-icons
  - tailwind css (visit the official website to install tailwind for Vite as this project was created as a vite project)
